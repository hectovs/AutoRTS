# AutoRTS
Some Python (using selenium)  to automate input into the Reactive Training Systems Web App. 
You'll need python3 and chrome installed.

 How to:

  If you haven't already, install Python 3 and a code editor of your choice on your system (eg VS code, Sublime Text, Xcode etc)

  Set up  virtual environment in this folder on your system (NB. this will be different on a windows OS)
  1. Open terminal 
  2. Create your virtual environemnt, type into terminal: python3 -m venv venv 
  3. then activate the virtual environment, type: . venv/bin/activate
  4. Install the requirements, type: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  You will only need to perform step 2 once for each iteration of this code on your system
  Step 3 will need to be repeated everytime you open a new terminal window in situ          

  Now go to RTSday1.csv and edit the file to make the workout you want to input, do not edit the format!
  You can copy this file in place to create RTSday2.csv etc 

  Then open the user_control.py file and edit it to suit your requirements 

  Then run user_control.py (type into terminal: python3 user_control.py)

  Report problems and issues and I'll do my best to fix them.
